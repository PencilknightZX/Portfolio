                    <p>
                        Hi, I'm Emmanuel Ifeanyi, a Computer Science student at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF). 
                        A fun fact about me: I was born and raised in Ireland, where I lived for 12 years before moving to sunny California in 2014.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My journey as a developer has been fueled by a mix of technical skills and creative passions. I specialize in programming, 
                        web development, and working with REST APIs, FastAPI, React, and Git. These skills enable me to create functional and 
                        visually appealing solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not coding, you’ll find me indulging in my hobbies: making manga and comics, skateboarding, working out, 
                        cooking, or immersing myself in movies, shows, and anime. These interests not only reflect my personality but also 
                        enhance my creativity and problem-solving abilities as a developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I aim to merge my love for technology, design, and storytelling into innovative projects that make an impact. 
                        Let's connect and bring ideas to life!
                    </p>
