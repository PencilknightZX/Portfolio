            <h2>EzPaint</h2>
            <p>EzPaint is a user-friendly drawing application developed using C++ and wxWidgets. This project focuses on providing a simple yet powerful platform for creating digital artwork. Users can draw on a blank canvas, save their creations as PNG or XML files, and reload them later for further editing. The application is designed to cater to both beginners and advanced users with its intuitive interface and essential features.</p>

            <p>The primary goal of EzPaint is to deliver a lightweight and cross-platform drawing tool that prioritizes functionality and ease of use. The application offers a diverse color palette, drawing tools, and seamless file handling capabilities to enhance the user experience.</p>

            <h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>C++ - For core application logic and performance.</li>
                <li>wxWidgets - For creating a cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Challenges Faced:</h3>
            <p>One of the key challenges in developing EzPaint was handling XML parsing to save and reload user-created drawings. Ensuring data integrity and compatibility during file operations required careful implementation and testing.</p>

            <p>Another major challenge was maintaining cross-platform compatibility. Since wxWidgets supports multiple operating systems, ensuring consistent behavior and appearance across Windows, macOS, and Linux required extensive testing and debugging.</p>
